# Importing and Exporting Workflows

In the Workflow CMS admin-area, authorised users are able to export a WorkflowDefinition from one SilverStripe installation, and import
it into another.

To export a workflow; from the table of workflows in the Workflow CMS admin-area, select the 'download' icon located to the right of the 'edit' and 'delete' icons.

You should be prompted to download a file which you should save to your local computer.

To import, simply login to another SilverStripe installation and navigate to the Workflow Admin of that CMS. You should see an "Import" heading
at the bottom of the central CMS pane with a "Browse" button below that.

Select the "Browse" button and locate the downloaded file in the your computer's file-browser that will automatically appear, then select the
"Import Definition" button. That's it!

# Exported related user and group Data

Because users and groups can be related to Workflow Actions and Transitions, these associations are also exported. However, these relations will only
be made at the import stage if the same Groups and/or Users also exist in the target CMS, otherwise you will need to manually re-create the users and groups
and re-assign them to the imported workflow.
